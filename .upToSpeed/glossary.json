This discrepancy occurs due to market volatility and blockchain confirmation delays between when a transaction is submitted and when it's actually executed.\n\nTo protect users from unexpectedly unfavorable trade executions, DEXs implement slippage tolerance parameters, which allow users to specify a maximum acceptable percentage difference from their expected price. If the actual execution price would exceed this tolerance, the transaction automatically fails rather than executing at a potentially disadvantageous price.\n\nSlippage is particularly significant in markets with low liquidity or during periods of high volatility, as well as for large orders that may substantially impact the trading pool's balance.

When the market price crosses your specified range, your deposited token is automatically swapped for the other token in the pair. For example, if you want to sell ETH for USDC when ETH reaches $2,000, you would create a position providing ETH liquidity just below the $2,000 price point.\n\nA key advantage of this mechanism is that your assets can earn trading fees while waiting for the order to execute, unlike traditional limit orders which sit idle until filled."

The fees are often added directly to the liquidity pool, increasing the value of LP tokens over time.\n\nWhile providing liquidity can be profitable through these fees, liquidity providers must also be aware of impermanent loss—potential value reduction that occurs when the price ratio of deposited assets changes compared to simply holding those assets."

    "definition": "# Concentrated Liquidity\n\nConcentrated liquidity is a capital efficiency mechanism in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that allows liquidity providers to allocate their assets within specific price ranges rather than across the entire price spectrum. Unlike traditional automated market makers (AMMs) that spread liquidity from zero to infinity, concentrated liquidity enables providers to focus their capital where it's most likely to be utilized - typically around the current market price.\n\nIn this model, liquidity providers create positions with custom upper and lower price boundaries (often represented as \"ticks\"). When the market price falls within this range, the position is active and earns trading fees. If the price moves outside the specified range, the position becomes inactive until the price returns to that range.\n\nThe key innovation is that concentrated liquidity significantly improves capital efficiency (often by 200-300×) by ensuring assets are deployed where they're most needed. This results in:\n\n1. Better execution prices for traders due to reduced slippage\n2. Higher fee generation for liquidity providers relative to capital deployed\n3. Customizable risk/reward profiles based on price range selection\n4. Support for range orders similar to limit orders in traditional exchanges\n\nFirst introduced by Uniswap V3, concentrated liquidity represents a fundamental advancement in AMM design that helps DEXs compete more effectively with centralized exchanges in terms of capital efficiency and trading experience."

As one token's supply increases in the pool, the other decreases according to the formula, creating a price curve where larger trades face proportionally higher price impact.\n\nThis mechanism enables permissionless trading without order books, as prices are determined purely by the mathematical relationship between token reserves. Liquidity providers deposit equal values of both tokens to maintain the constant product, earning trading fees in return.\n\nWhile fundamental to DeFi protocols like Uniswap, this formula is unrelated to the libsecp256k1 cryptography library shown in the context, which focuses on elliptic curve operations for digital signatures rather than token exchange mechanisms."

It represents the price at which an infinitesimally small trade could occur without affecting the market. Unlike actual execution prices, the mid price does not account for slippage or liquidity depth.\n\nMid price serves as a reference value for many DeFi calculations including arbitrage opportunities, portfolio valuations, and as a benchmark against which actual trade prices can be compared.

This creates a constant availability of liquidity without needing counterparties for each trade.\n\n## Key Components\n\n1. **Liquidity Pools**: Smart contract-managed token reserves where users deposit pairs of assets (like ETH/USDC) to earn trading fees.\n\n2. **Pricing Formula**: A mathematical function that determines token exchange rates based on the relative quantities of tokens in the pool.\n\n3. **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**: Users who deposit tokens into pools and receive LP tokens representing their share of the pool, earning trading fees in return.\n\n4. **Swappers**: Traders who exchange tokens through the pools by paying a small fee that goes to liquidity providers.\n\n## Common Pricing Models\n\n1. **Constant Product Formula** (x × y = k): The most widely used model (Uniswap v2, SushiSwap), where the product of token reserves remains constant after trades. This creates a hyperbolic price curve that increases exponentially as pool balances change.\n\n2. **Constant Sum Formula** (x + y = k): Aims to maintain a constant sum of assets, but lacks slippage protection.\n\n3. **Constant Mean Formula**: Balances multiple tokens using weighted averages (Balancer).\n\n4. **Stableswap Curve**: Designed for similar-valued assets like stablecoins, offering lower slippage for trades near parity (Curve Finance).\n\n5. **Concentrated Liquidity**: Allows LPs to provide liquidity within specific price ranges (Uniswap v3).\n\n## Advantages\n\n- **Permissionless**: Anyone can trade or provide liquidity without approval.\n- **Non-custodial**: Assets remain under user control via smart contracts.\n- **Always-on**: Markets operate 24/7 without intermediaries.\n- **Transparency**: All transactions and pool states are visible on-chain.\n- **Composability**: Can be integrated with other DeFi protocols.\n\n## Challenges\n\n- **Impermanent Loss**: LPs may lose value compared to holding when token prices diverge.\n- **Slippage**: Large trades cause significant price impact, especially in shallow pools.\n- **Capital Efficiency**: Traditional AMMs can be inefficient as liquidity is spread across the entire price curve.\n- **MEV Vulnerability**: Subject to front-running and sandwich attacks.\n- **Oracle Manipulation**: Price feeds derived from AMMs can be manipulated with flash loans.\n\n## Popular AMM Protocols\n\n- **Uniswap**: Pioneer of the constant product formula, now with concentrated liquidity in v3.\n- **Curve Finance**: Specialized for stablecoin and similar-value asset swaps.\n- **Balancer**: Allows custom token weights and multi-token pools.\n- **SushiSwap**: Fork of Uniswap with additional yield farming.\n- **Trader Joe**: Popular AMM on Avalanche.\n- **PancakeSwap**: Leading AMM on BNB Chain.\n\n## Recent Innovations\n\n- **Dynamic Fees**: Adjusting swap fees based on volatility or liquidity depth.\n- **Just-in-time Liquidity**: Temporary liquidity provision to capture swap fees.\n- **Hybrid Models**: Combining AMM features with limit orders or CLOB elements.\n- **Layer 2 Deployments**: Implementations on scaling solutions for lower fees.\n- **Cross-chain AMMs**: Facilitating trades across different blockchains.\n\nAMM protocols have revolutionized decentralized trading by eliminating the need for traditional order books and introducing an entirely new paradigm for market making that is accessible to everyone.

This approach enables applications to implement custom transaction ordering logic optimized for their specific needs and use cases.\n\n## Core Concept\n\nIn traditional blockchain systems, transaction sequencing is typically handled at the protocol level by validators or miners according to universal rules (e.g., based on gas fees or timestamps). With Application-Specific Sequencing, this responsibility is delegated to the application layer, allowing different applications to implement custom ordering policies that better suit their particular requirements.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n1. **Reduced MEV (Miner Extractable Value)**: By controlling transaction ordering at the application level, ASS can significantly reduce harmful MEV extraction such as frontrunning and sandwich attacks that exploit the default ordering mechanisms.\n\n2. **Improved User Experience**: Applications can prioritize transactions based on application-specific fairness criteria rather than gas price, potentially reducing costs for users.\n\n3. **Customized Fairness Models**: Different applications can implement different notions of fairness—first-come-first-served, pro-rata distribution, or other specialized ordering rules.\n\n4. **Domain-Specific Optimization**: Applications can optimize transaction ordering for their specific domain, such as batch processing similar transactions or implementing application-level timeouts.\n\n5. **Greater Predictability**: Users can better predict how their transactions will be processed since the ordering follows application-specific rules rather than network-wide competition.\n\n## Implementation Approaches\n\nThere are several ways to implement Application-Specific Sequencing:\n\n1. **Dedicated Sequencers**: Applications can designate special nodes (sequencers) responsible for ordering transactions before they're submitted to the blockchain.\n\n2. **Smart Contract Rules**: Applications can encode transaction ordering rules directly in smart contracts, enforcing specific sequencing constraints during execution.\n\n3. **Layer 2 Solutions**: Many Layer 2 scaling solutions (like rollups) support application-specific sequencing by design, allowing applications to control ordering before transactions are batched to the main chain.\n\n4. **Domain-Specific Chains**: Some blockchain ecosystems allow for application-specific blockchains (e.g., app-chains) where the entire consensus process can be tailored to specific application requirements.\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\nASS is particularly valuable for:\n\n- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes)**: Preventing frontrunning and ensuring fair price execution\n- **NFT Marketplaces**: Ensuring fair minting processes for high-demand drops\n- **DeFi Lending Platforms**: Prioritizing liquidations or interest rate adjustments in a predictable manner\n- **Gaming Applications**: Managing in-game transactions and player interactions with custom timing rules\n- **Decentralized Auctions**: Enforcing bid ordering policies specific to auction mechanics\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n1. **Centralization Risk**: If sequencing is controlled by a single entity, it may reintroduce centralization risks.\n\n2. **Composability**: Applications with different sequencing rules may face challenges when attempting to interact with each other.\n\n3. **Implementation Complexity**: Building robust, secure sequencing mechanisms requires additional development effort and expertise.\n\n4. **Performance Overhead**: Custom sequencing logic may introduce additional processing overhead compared to simpler ordering rules.\n\n5. **Security Validation**: Custom sequencing rules must be carefully designed to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nApplication-Specific Sequencing represents an important evolution in blockchain design, moving transaction ordering responsibility from the protocol level to the application level. By allowing applications to define their own ordering policies, ASS enables more efficient, fair, and predictable transaction processing tailored to specific use cases, particularly in high-value domains like DeFi where transaction ordering significantly impacts outcomes."

This value represents the economic incentive that validators, miners, or other participants have to reorganize or prioritize transactions in ways that benefit themselves, potentially at the expense of regular users.\n\n## Key Concepts of MEV\n\n### How MEV Works\n\nMEV opportunities arise from several key blockchain characteristics:\n\n1. **Transaction Ordering**: Block producers have discretion over which transactions to include and in what order.\n\n2. **Priority Access**: Block producers see transactions before they're confirmed, giving them an information advantage.\n\n3. **Front-Running Opportunity**: The ability to observe pending transactions and insert one's own transactions before them.\n\n4. **Economic Incentives**: The financial motivation to extract value through strategic transaction placement.\n\n### Common MEV Strategies\n\n1. **Sandwich Attacks**: Placing transactions both before and after a user's transaction to profit from price movements.\n\n2. **Arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences across different exchanges or platforms.\n\n3. **Liquidation Racing**: Competing to be the first to liquidate under-collateralized positions.\n\n4. **Front-Running**: Observing pending transactions and executing similar ones with higher gas prices to get priority.\n\n5. **Back-Running**: Placing transactions immediately after significant transactions that affect market conditions.\n\n### Impact on Blockchain Ecosystems\n\nMEV has several significant effects:\n\n1. **User Experience**: Users may face higher transaction costs and worse execution prices.\n\n2. **Network Congestion**: Competition for MEV opportunities can lead to gas price wars, increasing network fees.\n\n3. **Centralization Risks**: MEV extraction often favors sophisticated actors with specialized infrastructure.\n\n4. **Market Inefficiency**: MEV can distort markets and create negative externalities for regular users.\n\n## MEV Mitigation Approaches\n\nVarious solutions have emerged to address MEV problems:\n\n1. **Batch Processing**: Processing transactions in batches at uniform prices (as mentioned in Angstrom's approach).\n\n2. **MEV Auctions**: Systems like Flashbots that create separate markets for transaction ordering rights.\n\n3. **Timelock Puzzles**: Encryption techniques that prevent transactions from being visible until a certain time.\n\n4. **Fair Sequencing Services**: Independent transaction ordering services that follow predetermined rules.\n\n5. **Value Redistribution**: Mechanisms that capture MEV and distribute it back to users or liquidity providers.\n\n## Angstrom's MEV Approach\n\nAccording to the documentation, Angstrom implements:\n\n1. **Batch Processing of Limit Orders**: All limit orders are cleared in batches at uniform prices, preventing selective execution that could harm users.\n\n2. **Top of Block (ToB) Auction**: A mechanism to redistribute value that would otherwise be extracted by arbitrageurs back to liquidity providers.\n\n3. **Censorship Resistance**: Systems to limit the ability of block producers to censor specific transactions.\n\n## MEV in Context\n\nMEV represents a fundamental challenge in blockchain design because it emerges from the same properties that give blockchains their value - decentralized consensus, transparency, and permissionless participation. The goal of MEV mitigation is not necessarily to eliminate all MEV (which may be impossible without compromising on other blockchain properties), but rather to ensure that value extraction doesn't harm regular users or undermine the integrity of the system.\n\nBy addressing MEV systematically, protocols like Angstrom attempt to create more equitable and efficient decentralized systems that better serve all participants."
